# Knee
Knee pain and complications are one of the most common anomalies that affect people of all
ages. It requires the patients to undergo intensive treatment for a long time. Knee pain may be
the result of an injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. Medical conditions including
arthritis, gout, and infections also can cause knee pain. The present state of society in both
developing and developed countries though due to dissimilar reasons are foreshadowing a rise
in knee complications. The treatment process involves some recurrent measurement in order to
assess progress such as goniometry. It may be neglected by the patients as the equipment are
complex and takes more time. Medical professionals use flexion angle as a yardstick to assess
the angle of motion of the knee.Flexion angle of a knee is the angle measured between 3
points,the center of the leg,center of the knee and center of the thigh.A deep learning approach is presented using a synthetic dataset to
measure the flexion angle of the knee.
